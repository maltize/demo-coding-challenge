Rubymon is a mobile app that allows players to catch, collect monsters, and eventually battle them. The game is played on a mobile app but we want to store user and monster information in the cloud. We need you to create a RESTful backend API to store and organize the monsters.

User Requirements
+ 1. User can register via their Facebook account.
+ 2. User can create a monster with the following attributes (string descriptors): name, power, and type.
+ 3. Each monster can be one of five types: fire, water, earth, electric, wind.
4. Each type is strong against one, weak against another:
	fire < water < earth < electric < wind < fire...
+ 5. User can organize monsters into teams of three.
+ 6. User can have up to a total of 20 monsters and 3 teams.
+- 7. User can view all their monsters and sort by name, power, or weakness.
+ 8. User can manage monsters with CRUD web pages.

CONCLUSION AFTER ~3 hours of work:
Not enough time for point 4 and part of 7(sorting by weakness).
Lots of things should be improved and refactored (like team <=> monsters connection).
Instead of bare models, I would like to create presenters in place, between controllers and views.
Tests should be correctly implemented, and many other things :)
